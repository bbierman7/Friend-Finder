# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is essentially a dating app. It is a full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

This app uses Express to handle routing. It is also deployed through Heroku so other users can fill it out. Below is the Heroku link:
